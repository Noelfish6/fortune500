        <h1 class="text-center">The Rise and Fall of the Greater China's Economy</h1>
        <h3 class="text-center">Based on The Perspective of View of Enterprise Ranking</h3>
        <p class="text-center intro">China's economy has grown rapidly after its economic reform, however, Hong Kong and Taiwan's economic performance in recent years gradually slows down and declines. Li Ka-shing, a Hong Kong investor and the richest person in Asia, publicly foresaw the worst economy in two decades in Hong Kong. Taiwanese workers’ real salaries have seen zero growth since 2000.</br>Fortune 500 is generally assumed to mirror the economy. Here, we want to use the data visualization to test this hypothesis: enterprise ranking can reflect economic growth. The data is based on the past two decades from Fortune 500.</p>
